# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists; it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**; read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```text
/
+-- CONTEXT.md
+-- docs/adr/
|   +-- 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
|   +-- 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
+-- src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```text
/
+-- CONTEXT-MAP.md
+-- docs/adr/
+-- src/
    +-- ordering/
    |   +-- CONTEXT.md
    |   +-- docs/adr/
    +-- billing/
        +-- CONTEXT.md
        +-- docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, either you're inventing language the project doesn't use or there's a real gap to note for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
